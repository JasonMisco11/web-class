            <p>The World Wide Web was created by<strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in 1989 while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. It was initially conceived as a way for CERN scientists to share information more easily, but
                its impact has grown far beyond that.</p>

            <p>The web is built on top of the Internet, which provides the infrastructure for data transfer. By inventing the web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee introduced a system of interconnected hypertext documents that could be accessed over the Internet using
                a web browser.</p>

            <p>The key technologies of the web include <strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong>for structuring the content, <strong>(Hypertext Transfer Protocol),</strong> for requesting and transmitting web pages, and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
                for addressing the resources on the web.</p>

            <p>With the World Wide Web, information and knowledge became easily accessible to people all around the world. It revolutionized communication, commerce, education, and countless other aspects of society.</p>
